        ## Description
        
        Finely identify the whole genome duplication events and generate the genomic homology tables. This is a gold standard for complex genomic analysis,including the construction of homologous gene dotplot, event-related genomic alignment, and synonymous substitutions, and differences in different evolution rates, etc.
        
        ## Installation
        
        Python package and command line interface (CLI) for the analysis of whole genome duplications (WGDs). 安装需要的环境是python3. 
        
        ```bash
        pip3 install wgdi
        ```
        
        For **external software** requirements: please consult the relevant section in the docs: <https://wgdi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#external-software>
        
        To use as a Python package as well as to find additional documentation and examples for the CLI, please consult the docs at<http://wgdi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>
